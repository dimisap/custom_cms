# custom_cms

This is a custom CMS made by me, as a simple replica of star.gr.

In this app you can create articles and categories and be able to watch them afterwards.

In order for this project to work, it is needed to create a database with name "star" and import the 2 sql files(articles, categories).

Improvements need to be done: Administration rights, so only the admin can be able to upload articles.
